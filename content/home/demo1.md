In collaboration with Andrew Emili and Jack Greenblatt laboratories at the University of Boston and Toronto, we have extensively mapped physical interactions with high confidence via large-scale isolation and characterization of endogenous soluble and membrane protein complexes under near-physiological conditions using affinity-purification of chromosomally-tagged proteins in combination with mass spectrometry (AP-MS) in organisms such as the yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* and eubacterium *Escherichia coli*. 

Currently, Babuâ€™s laboratory is engaged in leveraging this approach to other models, including neuron-like cell lines and induced pluripotent stem cells, to address the critical question of how bioprocesses are integrated with one another in cellular pathways and complexes, with special focus on unique cellular compartments such as the mitochondria. Complementary techniques such as co-fractionation both support and expand these techniques to healthy and diseased neuronal tissues with the goal of understanding how networks change during neurodegeneration.
