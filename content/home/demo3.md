Finally, in collaboration with researchers in Toronto, we are focusing on establishing computational frameworks and machine learning algorithms for processing, integrating, and interpreting large-scale interaction datasets with the aim of understanding the cell physiology. 

As well, we are investigating the evolutionary trajectory of biological pathways and complexes using comparative genomic methods to identify a spectrum of behaviors, including complexes that are of highly modular for drug target discovery.
