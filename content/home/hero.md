The primary research focus of Babuâ€™s laboratory is to characterize the comprehensive networks of physical (protein-protein) and functional (gene-gene, or genetic) interaction maps that underlie major cellular processes in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. 

The resulting physical and functional interaction maps will be integrated to organize protein complexes into higher order pathways that mediate and coordinate major bioprocesses in the cell. 

The knowledge gained from these interaction maps will not only enhance the fundamental understanding of the molecular wiring of proteins in the cells, but also provide mechanistic insights that could be potentially exploited for identifying novel therapeutic targets as well as therapies for the treatment of human diseases.
