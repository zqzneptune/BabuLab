Either through joint research grants or fee-for-services, we provide a wide range of state-of-the-art amenities, including large-scale proteomics and genetics screens, drug screening, small molecule profiling, tag or antibody-based affinity purifications, protein identification with high mass accuracy, post-translational modifications, proteomic profiling, targeted quantitative proteomics, and characterizing full length proteins.

Since analyzing the large-scale datasets is often challenging to clinicians, translational, and basic researchers, we offer services with bioinformatics analyses, especially with proteomics, genetic or epistatic interactions, metabolomics, high-throughput sequencing, gene set enrichment analysis, gene expression, human disease-associated genetic variants, and with other sources of biological data. In addition, we assist with web-based visualization to understand complex data, and many other applications.

Our staff currently participates in large-scale multidisciplinary projects and we welcome new collaborations on developing new technologies and designing or tailoring proteomics/genomics experiments for publications and grant proposals. We offer our services at a reasonable rate in the shortest possible time. Beginning this year, we offer monthly and summer short courses, and hands-on training on mass spectrometry and other genomics equipment can also be arranged on a fee-for-service.
