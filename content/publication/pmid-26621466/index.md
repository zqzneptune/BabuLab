abstract: "High-throughput genomic and proteomic methods provide a concise description of the molecular constituents of a cell, whereas systems biology strives to understand the way these components function as a whole. Recent developments, such as genome editing technologies and protein epitope-tagging coupled with high-sensitivity mass-spectrometry, allow systemic studies to be performed at an unprecedented scale. Available methods can be successfully applied to various goals, both expanding fundamental knowledge and solving applied problems. In this review, we discuss the present state and future of bacterial cell envelope interactomics, with a specific focus on host-pathogen interactions and drug target discovery. Both experimental and computational methods will be outlined together with examples of their practical implementation. "
