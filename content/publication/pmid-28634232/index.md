abstract: "The histidine-phosphorylatable phosphocarrier protein (HPr) is an essential component of the sugar-transporting phosphotransferase system (PTS) in many bacteria. Recent interactome findings suggested that HPr interacts with several carbohydrate-metabolizing enzymes, but whether HPr plays a regulatory role was unclear. Here, we provide evidence that HPr interacts with a large number of proteins in Escherichia coli We demonstrate HPr-dependent allosteric regulation of the activities of pyruvate kinase (PykF, but not PykA), phosphofructokinase (PfkB, but not PfkA), glucosamine-6-phosphate deaminase (NagB), and adenylate kinase (Adk). HPr is either phosphorylated on a histidyl residue (HPr-P) or non-phosphorylated (HPr). PykF is activated only by non-phosphorylated HPr, which decreases the PykF Khalf for phosphoenolpyruvate by 10-fold (from 3.5 to 0.36 mm), thus influencing glycolysis. PfkB activation by HPr, but not by HPr-P, resulted from a decrease in the Khalf for fructose-6-P, which likely influences both gluconeogenesis and glycolysis. Moreover, NagB activation by HPr was important for the utilization of amino sugars, and allosteric inhibition of Adk activity by HPr-P, but not by HPr, allows HPr to regulate the cellular energy charge coordinately with glycolysis. These observations suggest that HPr serves as a directly interacting global regulator of carbon and energy metabolism and probably of other physiological processes in enteric bacteria."
