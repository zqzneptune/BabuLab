abstract: "Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) is a highly conserved pathway that repairs Double-Strand Breaks (DSBs) within DNA. Here we show that the deletion of yeast uncharacterized ORF HUR1, Hydroxyurea Resistance1 affects the efficiency of NHEJ. Our findings are supported by Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI), genetic interaction and drug sensitivity analyses. To assess the activity of HUR1 in DSB repair, we deleted its non-overlapping region with PMR1, referred to as HUR1-A. We observed that similar to deletion of TPK1 and NEJ1, and unlike YKU70 (important for NHEJ of DNA with overhang and not blunt end), deletion of HUR1-A reduced the efficiency of NHEJ in both overhang and blunt end plasmid repair assays. Similarly, a chromosomal repair assay showed a reduction for repair efficiency when HUR1-A was deleted. In agreement with a functional connection for Hur1p with Tpk1p and NEJ1p, double mutant strains Δhur1-A/Δtpk1, and Δhur1-A/Δnej1 showed the same reduction in the efficiency of plasmid repair, compared to both single deletion strains. Also, using a Homologous Recombination (HR) specific plasmid-based DSB repair assay we observed that deletion of HUR1-A influenced the efficiency of HR repair, suggesting that HUR1 might also play additional roles in other DNA repair pathways."
