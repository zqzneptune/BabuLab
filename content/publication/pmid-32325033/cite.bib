 abstract = {Connectivity webs mediate the unique biology of the mammalian brain. Yet, while cell circuit maps are increasingly available, knowledge of their underlying molecular networks remains limited. Here, we applied multi-dimensional biochemical fractionation with mass spectrometry and machine learning to survey endogenous macromolecules across the adult mouse brain. We defined a global "interactome" comprising over one thousand multi-protein complexes. These include hundreds of brain-selective assemblies that have distinct physical and functional attributes, show regional and cell-type specificity, and have links to core neurological processes and disorders. Using reciprocal pull-downs and a transgenic model, we validated a putative 28-member RNA-binding protein complex associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, suggesting a coordinated function in alternative splicing in disease progression. This brain interaction map (BraInMap) resource facilitates mechanistic exploration of the unique molecular machinery driving core cellular processes of the central nervous system. It is publicly available and can be explored here https://www.bu.edu/dbin/cnsb/mousebrain/.},
