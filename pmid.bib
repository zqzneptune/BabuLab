    abstract = {Antifungal drug discovery and design is very challenging because of the considerable similarities in genetic features and metabolic pathways between fungi and humans. However, cell wall composition represents a notable point of divergence. Therefore, a research strategy was designed to improve our understanding of the mechanisms for maintaining fungal cell wall integrity, and to identify potential targets for new drugs that modulate the underlying protein-protein interactions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae This study defines roles for Wsc2p and Wsc3p and their interacting protein partners in the cell wall integrity signaling and cell survival mechanisms that respond to treatments with fluconazole and hydrogen peroxide. By combined genetic and biochemical approaches, we report the discovery of 12 novel protein interactors of Wsc2p and Wsc3p. Of these, Wsc2p interacting partners Gtt1p and Yck2p, have opposing roles in the resistance and sensitivity to fluconazole treatments respectively. The interaction of Wsc2p with Ras2p was confirmed by iMYTH and IP-MS approaches and is shown to play a dominant role in response to oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide. Consistent with an earlier study, Ras2p was also identified as an interacting partner of Wsc1p and Mid2p cell wall integrity signaling proteins. Collectively, this study expands the interaction networks of the mechanosensory proteins of the Cell Wall Integrity pathway.},

    abstract = {Lithium Chloride (LiCl) toxicity, mode of action and cellular responses have been the subject of active investigations over the past decades. In yeast, LiCl treatment is reported to reduce the activity and alters the expression of PGM2, a gene that encodes a phosphoglucomutase involved in sugar metabolism. Reduced activity of phosphoglucomutase in the presence of galactose causes an accumulation of intermediate metabolites of galactose metabolism leading to a number of phenotypes including growth defect. In the current study, we identify two understudied yeast genes, YTA6 and YPR096C that when deleted, cell sensitivity to LiCl is increased when galactose is used as a carbon source. The 5'-UTR of PGM2 mRNA is structured. Using this region, we show that YTA6 and YPR096C influence the translation of PGM2 mRNA.},
