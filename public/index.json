HERG plays critical role in cardiac repolarization, and mutations in HERG can cause long QT syndrome. More recently, evidence has emerged that HERG channels are aberrantly expressed in many kinds of cancer cells and play important roles in cancer progression. HERG could therefore be a potential biomarker for cancer and a possible molecular target for anticancer drug design. HERG affects a number of cellular processes, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis and migration, any of which could be affected by dysregulation of HERG. This review provides an overview of available information on HERG channel as it relates to cancer, with focus on the mechanism by which HERG influences cancer progression. Molecular docking attempts suggest two possible protein-protein interactions of HERG with the ß1-integrin receptor and the transcription factor STAT-1 as novel HERG-directed therapeutic targeting which avoids possible cardiotoxicity. The role of epigenetics in regulating HERG channel expression and activity in cancer will also be discussed. Finally, given its inherent extracellular accessibility as an ion channel, we discuss regulatory roles of this molecule in cancer physiology and therapeutic potential. Future research should be directed to explore the possibilities of therapeutic interventions targeting HERG channels while minding possible complications.","tags":null,"title":"HERG channel and cancer: A mechanistic review of carcinogenic processes and therapeutic potential.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ashwani Kumar","Ali Hosseinnia","Alla Gagarinova","Sadhna Phanse","Sunyoung Kim","Khaled A Aly","Sandra Zilles","Mohan Babu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1580515200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580515200,"objectID":"9e9ad4da5401e46ee4fed615d9f2b89b","permalink":"http://192.157.236.170/BabuLab/publication/pmid-31504172/","publishdate":"2020-07-10T06:21:58.719727Z","relpermalink":"/BabuLab/publication/pmid-31504172/","section":"publication","summary":"A digenic genetic interaction (GI) is observed when mutations in two genes within the same organism yield a phenotype that is different from the expected, given each mutation's individual effects.

Altered mtPPIs are linked to neurodegenerative disorders (NDs) and drivers of pathological associations to mediate ND progression. Mapping altered mtPPIs will reveal how mt dysfunction is linked to NDs.Areas covered: This review discusses how database sources reflect on the number of mt protein or interaction predictions, and serves as an update on mtPPIs in mt dynamics and homeostasis. Emphasis is given to mRNA expression profiles for mt proteins in human tissues, cellular models relevant to NDs, and altered mtPPIs in NDs such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Alzheimer's disease (AD).Expert opinion: We highlight the scarcity of biomarkers to improve diagnostic accuracy and tracking of ND progression, obstacles in recapitulating NDs using human cellular models to underpin the pathophysiological mechanisms of disease, and the shortage of mt protein interactome reference database(s) of neuronal cells. These bottlenecks are addressed by improvements in induced pluripotent stem cell creation and culturing, patient-derived 3D brain organoids to recapitulate structural arrangements of the brain, and cell sorting to elucidate mt proteome disparities between cell types.","tags":null,"title":"Misconnecting the dots: altered mitochondrial protein-protein interactions and their role in neurodegenerative disorders.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mara Zilocchi","Ilaria Colugnat","Marta Lualdi","Monica Meduri","Federica Marini","Victor Corasolla Carregari","Mohamed Taha Moutaoufik","Sadhna Phanse","Luisa Pieroni","Mohan Babu","Barbara Garavaglia","Mauro Fasano","Tiziana Alberio"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"b494c063e32901923ea322f481cfd928","permalink":"http://192.157.236.170/BabuLab/publication/pmid-32596240/","publishdate":"2020-07-10T06:21:58.701151Z","relpermalink":"/BabuLab/publication/pmid-32596240/","section":"publication","summary":"Mutations in PARK2 gene are the most frequent cause of familial forms of Parkinson's disease (PD).

In conclusion, the present work highlighted new molecular factors and pathways altered by PARK2 mutations, which will unravel possible biochemical pathways altered in the sporadic form of PD.","tags":null,"title":"Exploring the Impact of PARK2 Mutations on the Total and Mitochondrial Proteome of Human Skin Fibroblasts.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bálint Kintses","Pramod K Jangir","Gergely Fekete","Mónika Számel","Orsolya Méhi","Réka Spohn","Lejla Daruka","Ana Martins","Ali Hosseinnia","Alla Gagarinova","Sunyoung Kim","Sadhna Phanse","Bálint Csörgő","Ádám Györkei","Eszter Ari","Viktória Lázár","István Nagy","Mohan Babu","Csaba Pál","Balázs Papp"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1575158400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575158400,"objectID":"f6316327feb2c5c6f2b0460805f0e2b0","permalink":"http://192.157.236.170/BabuLab/publication/pmid-31844052/","publishdate":"2020-07-10T06:21:58.71747Z","relpermalink":"/BabuLab/publication/pmid-31844052/","section":"publication","summary":"Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are key effectors of the innate immune system and promising therapeutic agents.

While PCP has been successfully applied to soluble proteomes, characterization of the membrane interactome has lagged, partly due to the necessary use of detergents to maintain protein solubility. Here, we apply the peptidisc, a 'one-size fits all' membrane mimetic, for the capture of the Escherichia coli cell envelope proteome and its high-resolution fractionation in the absence of detergent. Analysis of the SILAC-labeled peptidisc library via PCP allows generation of over 4900 possible binary interactions out of 700,000 random associations. Using well-characterized membrane protein systems such as the SecY translocon, the Bam complex and the MetNI transporter, we demonstrate that our dataset is a useful resource for identifying transient and surprisingly novel protein interactions. For example, we discover a trans-periplasmic supercomplex comprising subunits of the Bam and Sec machineries, including membrane-bound chaperones YfgM and PpiD. We identify RcsF and OmpA as bone fide interactors of BamA, and we show that MetQ association with the ABC transporter MetNI depends on its N-terminal lipid anchor. We also discover NlpA as a novel interactor of MetNI complex. Most of these interactions are largely undetected by standard detergent-based purification. Together, the peptidisc workflow applied to the proteomic field is emerging as a promising novel approach to characterize membrane protein interactions under native expression conditions and without genetic manipulation.","tags":null,"title":"Profiling the Escherichia coli membrane protein interactome captured in Peptidisc libraries.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ednalise Santiago-Cartagena","Sahily González-Crespo","Vladimir Vélez","Nelson Martínez","Jamie Snider","Matthew Jessulat","Hiroyuki Aoki","Zoran Minic","Pearl Akamine","Inoushka Mejías","Luis M Pérez","Brian C Rymond","Mohan Babu","Igor Stagljar","José R Rodríguez-Medina"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1554076800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554076800,"objectID":"dd244c16a19aaa04505c5466c521270d","permalink":"http://192.157.236.170/BabuLab/publication/pmid-30733383/","publishdate":"2020-07-10T06:21:58.721741Z","relpermalink":"/BabuLab/publication/pmid-30733383/","section":"publication","summary":"Wsc1p and Mid2p are transmembrane signaling proteins of cell wall stress in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae When an environmental stress compromises cell wall integrity, they activate a cell response through the Cell Wall Integrity (CWI) pathway.

Binding of Rom2p to the cytoplasmic tail of Wsc1p requires dephosphorylation of specific serine residues but the mechanism by which the sensor is dephosphorylated and how it subsequently interacts with Rom2p remains unclear. We hypothesize that Wsc1p and Mid2p must be physically associated with interacting proteins other than Rom2p that facilitate its interaction and regulate the activation of CWI pathway. To address this, a cDNA plasmid library of yeast proteins was expressed in bait strains bearing membrane yeast two-hybrid (MYTH) reporter modules of Wsc1p and Mid2p, and their interacting preys were recovered and sequenced. 14 previously unreported interactors were confirmed for Wsc1p and 29 for Mid2p The interactors' functionality were assessed by cell growth assays and CWI pathway activation by western blot analysis of Slt2p/Mpk1p phosphorylation in null mutants of each interactor under defined stress conditions.

While mass-spectrometry (MS) based approaches possess the high sensitivity ideal for such an endeavor, it also requires stringent biochemical purification of bait proteins to avoid detecting spurious, non-specific PPIs. Here, we outline a tagging-based affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry (AP-MS) workflow for discovering new mt protein associations and providing novel insights into their role in mt biology and human physiology/pathology. Because AP-MS relies on the creation of proteins fused with affinity tags, we employ a versatile-affinity (VA) tag, consisting of 3× FLAG, 6 × His, and Strep III epitopes. For efficient delivery of affinity-tagged open reading frames (ORF) into mammalian cells, the VA-tag is cloned onto a specific ORF using Gateway recombinant cloning, and the resulting expression vector is stably introduced in target cells using lentiviral transduction. In this chapter, we show a functional workflow for mapping the mt interactome that includes tagging, stable transduction, selection and expansion of mammalian cell lines, mt extraction, identification of interacting protein partners by AP-MS, and lastly, computational assessment of protein complexes/PPI networks.","tags":null,"title":"A Tag-Based Affinity Purification Mass Spectrometry Workflow for Systematic Isolation of the Human Mitochondrial Protein Complexes.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mark F Mabanglo","Elisa Leung","Siavash Vahidi","Thiago V Seraphim","Bryan T Eger","Steve Bryson","Vaibhav Bhandari","Jin Lin Zhou","Yu-Qian Mao","Kamran Rizzolo","Marim M Barghash","Jordan D Goodreid","Sadhna Phanse","Mohan Babu","Leandro R S Barbosa","Carlos H I Ramos","Robert A Batey","Lewis E Kay","Emil F Pai","Walid A Houry"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"3a43bc257dd52d09bc8ef58b1dfa1844","permalink":"http://192.157.236.170/BabuLab/publication/pmid-31754640/","publishdate":"2020-07-10T06:21:58.718224Z","relpermalink":"/BabuLab/publication/pmid-31754640/","section":"publication","summary":"Bacterial ClpP is a highly conserved, cylindrical, self-compartmentalizing serine protease required for maintaining cellular proteostasis.

This is likely due to the resistance of slowly proliferating tumour-initiating cells (TICs), and understanding molecular mechanisms that control TICs behaviour is crucial for the development of effective therapeutic approaches. Here, we present our novel findings, indicating that an intrinsically catalytically inactive member of the Eph group of receptor tyrosine kinases, EPHB6, partially suppresses the epithelial-mesenchymal transition in TNBC cells, while also promoting expansion of TICs. Our work reveals that EPHB6 interacts with the GRB2 adapter protein and that its effect on enhancing cell proliferation is mediated by the activation of the RAS-ERK pathway, which allows it to elevate the expression of the TIC-related transcription factor, OCT4. Consistent with this, suppression of either ERK or OCT4 activities blocks EPHB6-induced pro-proliferative responses. In line with its ability to trigger propagation of TICs, EPHB6 accelerates tumour growth, potentiates tumour initiation and increases TIC populations in xenograft models of TNBC. Remarkably, EPHB6 also suppresses tumour drug resistance to DNA-damaging therapy, probably by forcing TICs into a more proliferative, drug-sensitive state. In agreement, patients with higher EPHB6 expression in their tumours have a better chance for recurrence-free survival. These observations describe an entirely new mechanism that governs TNBC and suggest that it may be beneficial to enhance EPHB6 action concurrent with applying a conventional DNA-damaging treatment, as it would decrease drug resistance and improve tumour elimination.","tags":null,"title":"EPHB6 augments both development and drug sensitivity of triple-negative breast cancer tumours.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kamran Rizzolo","Ashwani Kumar","Yoshito Kakihara","Sadhna Phanse","Zoran Minic","Jamie Snider","Igor Stagljar","Sandra Zilles","Mohan Babu","Walid A Houry"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1522540800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1522540800,"objectID":"9898efde5336bba0d47245de3f2fd677","permalink":"http://192.157.236.170/BabuLab/publication/pmid-29659649/","publishdate":"2020-07-10T06:21:58.800316Z","relpermalink":"/BabuLab/publication/pmid-29659649/","section":"publication","summary":"Molecular chaperones are typically promiscuous interacting proteins that function globally in the cell to maintain protein homeostasis.

NanE is essential for neuraminic acid (NANA) and N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc) utilization, and PII is known to be a central metabolic nitrogen regulator. We demonstrate that uridylylated PII (but not underivatized PII) activates NagB 10-fold at low concentrations of substrate, whereas NanE increases NagB activity 2-fold. NanE activates NagB in the absence or presence of GlcNAc-6P, but HPr and U-PII activation requires the presence of GlcNAc-6P. Activation of NagB by HPr and uridylylated PII, as well as by NanE and HPr (but not by NanE and U-PII), is synergistic, and the modeling, which suggests specific residues involved in complex formation, provides possible explanations. Specific physiological functions for the regulation of NagB by its three protein activators are proposed. Each regulatory agent is suggested to mediate signal transduction in response to a different stimulus.IMPORTANCE The regulation of amino sugar utilization is important for the survival of bacteria in a competitive environment. NagB, a glucosamine 6-phosphate deaminase in Escherichia coli, is essential for amino sugar utilization and is known to be allosterically regulated by N-acetylglucosamine 6-phosphate (GlcNAc-6P) and the histidine-phosphorylatable phosphocarrier protein, HPr. We provide evidence here that NanE, GlcNAc-6P epimerase, and the uridylylated PII protein allosterically activate NagB by direct protein-protein interactions. NanE is essential for N-acetylneuraminic acid (NANA) and N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc) utilization, and the PII protein is known to be a central metabolic nitrogen regulator.

After extraction with non-denaturing detergents, we affinity-purified 785 endogenously tagged CEPs and identified stably associated polypeptides by precision mass spectrometry. The resulting high-quality physical interaction network, comprising 77% of targeted CEPs, revealed many previously uncharacterized heteromeric complexes. We found that the secretion of autotransporters requires translocation and the assembly module TamB to nucleate proper folding from periplasm to cell surface through a cooperative mechanism involving the β-barrel assembly machinery. We also establish that an ABC transporter of unknown function, YadH, together with the Mla system preserves outer membrane lipid asymmetry.

Consequently, it is important to investigate the molecular mechanisms of cellular responses and detoxification pathways for these compounds in living organisms. To date, a number of genes have been linked to the detoxification process. The expression of these genes can be controlled at both transcriptional and translational levels. In baker's yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, resistance to a wide range of toxic metals is regulated by glutathione S-transferases. Yeast URE2 encodes for a protein that has glutathione peroxidase activity and is homologous to mammalian glutathione S-transferases. The URE2 expression is critical to cell survival under heavy metal stress. Here, we report on the finding of two genes, ITT1, an inhibitor of translation termination, and RPS1A, a small ribosomal protein, that when deleted yeast cells exhibit similar metal sensitivity phenotypes to gene deletion strain for URE2. Neither of these genes were previously linked to metal toxicity.

We compared renal oncocytomas with adjacent matched normal kidney tissues on a global scale by multi-omics approaches, including whole exome sequencing (WES), proteomics, metabolomics, and metabolic pathway simulation. The abundance of proteins localized to mitochondria increased more than 2-fold, the only exception was a strong decrease in the abundance for CI subunits that revealed several pathogenic heteroplasmic mtDNA mutations by WES. We also observed renal oncocytomas to dysregulate main metabolic pathways, shunting away from gluconeogenesis and lipid metabolism. Nevertheless, the abundance of energy carrier molecules such as NAD+, NADH, NADP, ATP, and ADP were significantly higher in renal oncocytomas.

Proteomics is playing key roles in understanding the molecular mechanisms of bacterial pathogenesis, and in identifying disease outcome determinants. The physical associations identified by proteomics can provide the means to develop pathogen-specific treatment methods that reduce the spread of antibiotic resistance and alleviate the negative effects of broad-spectrum antibiotics on beneficial bacteria. Areas covered: This review discusses recent trends in proteomics and introduces new and developing approaches that can be applied to the study of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) underlying bacterial pathogenesis. The approaches examined encompass options for mapping proteomes as well as stable and transient interactions in vivo and in vitro. We also explored the coverage of bacterial and human-bacterial PPIs, knowledge gaps in this area, and how they can be filled. Expert commentary: Identifying potential antimicrobial candidates is confounded by the complex molecular biology of bacterial pathogenesis and the lack of knowledge about PPIs underlying this process. Proteomics approaches can offer new perspectives for mechanistic insights and identify essential targets for guiding the discovery of next generation antimicrobials.","tags":null,"title":"Insights from protein-protein interaction studies on bacterial pathogenesis.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Irina A Rodionova","Zhongge Zhang","Jitender Mehla","Norman Goodacre","Mohan Babu","Andrew Emili","Peter Uetz","Milton H Saier"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1501545600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1501545600,"objectID":"6813a581559275674f7177d18a990553","permalink":"http://192.157.236.170/BabuLab/publication/pmid-28634232/","publishdate":"2020-07-10T06:21:58.846149Z","relpermalink":"/BabuLab/publication/pmid-28634232/","section":"publication","summary":"The histidine-phosphorylatable phosphocarrier protein (HPr) is an essential component of the sugar-transporting phosphotransferase system (PTS) in many bacteria. Recent interactome findings suggested that HPr interacts with several carbohydrate-metabolizing enzymes, but whether HPr plays a regulatory role was unclear. Here, we provide evidence that HPr interacts with a large number of proteins in Escherichia coli We demonstrate HPr-dependent allosteric regulation of the activities of pyruvate kinase (PykF, but not PykA), phosphofructokinase (PfkB, but not PfkA), glucosamine-6-phosphate deaminase (NagB), and adenylate kinase (Adk). HPr is either phosphorylated on a histidyl residue (HPr-P) or non-phosphorylated (HPr). PykF is activated only by non-phosphorylated HPr, which decreases the PykF Khalf for phosphoenolpyruvate by 10-fold (from 3.5 to 0.36 mm), thus influencing glycolysis. PfkB activation by HPr, but not by HPr-P, resulted from a decrease in the Khalf for fructose-6-P, which likely influences both gluconeogenesis and glycolysis. Moreover, NagB activation by HPr was important for the utilization of amino sugars, and allosteric inhibition of Adk activity by HPr-P, but not by HPr, allows HPr to regulate the cellular energy charge coordinately with glycolysis. These observations suggest that HPr serves as a directly interacting global regulator of carbon and energy metabolism and probably of other physiological processes in enteric bacteria.","tags":null,"title":"The phosphocarrier protein HPr of the bacterial phosphotransferase system globally regulates energy metabolism by directly interacting with multiple enzymes in Escherichia coli.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kate Sokolina","Saranya Kittanakom","Jamie Snider","Max Kotlyar","Pascal Maurice","Jorge Gandía","Abla Benleulmi-Chaachoua","Kenjiro Tadagaki","Atsuro Oishi","Victoria Wong","Ramy H Malty","Viktor Deineko","Hiroyuki Aoki","Shahreen Amin","Zhong Yao","Xavier Morató","David Otasek","Hiroyuki Kobayashi","Javier Menendez","Daniel Auerbach","Stephane Angers","Natasa Pržulj","Michel Bouvier","Mohan Babu","Francisco Ciruela","Ralf Jockers","Igor Jurisica","Igor Stagljar"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1488326400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1488326400,"objectID":"4e56d891a777165b98f6503c2636be6f","permalink":"http://192.157.236.170/BabuLab/publication/pmid-28298427/","publishdate":"2020-07-10T06:21:58.847624Z","relpermalink":"/BabuLab/publication/pmid-28298427/","section":"publication","summary":"G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest family of integral membrane receptors with key roles in regulating signaling pathways targeted by therapeutics, but are difficult to study using existing proteomics technologies due to their complex biochemical features.

The biology of cellular responses to stress has been a subject of vigorous investigations. Although much has been learned, details of some of these responses remain poorly understood. Members of heat shock chaperone HSP proteins have been linked to acetic acid and heat shock stress responses in yeast. Both acetic acid and heat shock have been identified to trigger different cellular responses including reduction of global protein synthesis and induction of programmed cell death. Yeast HSC82 and HSP82 code for two important heat shock proteins that together account for 1-2% of total cellular proteins. Both proteins have been linked to responses to acetic acid and heat shock. In contrast to the overall rate of protein synthesis which is reduced, the expression of HSC82 and HSP82 is induced in response to acetic acid stress. In the current study we identified two yeast genes DOM34 and RPL36A that are linked to acetic acid and heat shock sensitivity. We investigated the influence of these genes on the expression of HSP proteins.

The Myo1p tail-only domain was previously reported to have functional activity equivalent to the full-length Myo1p whereas the head-only domain did not. Since Myo1p tail-only constructs are biologically active, the tail domain must have additional functions beyond its previously described role in myosin dimerization or trimerization. The identification of new Myo1p-interacting proteins may shed light on the other functions of the Myo1p tail domain. To identify novel Myo1p-interacting proteins, and determine if Myo1p can serve as a scaffold to recruit proteins to the bud neck during cytokinesis, we used the integrated split-ubiquitin membrane yeast two-hybrid (iMYTH) system. Myo1p was iMYTH-tagged at its C-terminus, and screened against both cDNA and genomic prey libraries to identify interacting proteins. Control experiments showed that the Myo1p-bait construct was appropriately expressed, and that the protein colocalized to the yeast bud neck. Thirty novel Myo1p-interacting proteins were identified by iMYTH. Eight proteins were confirmed by coprecipitation (Ape2, Bzz1, Fba1, Pdi1, Rpl5, Tah11, and Trx2) or mass spectrometry (AP-MS) (Abp1). The novel Myo1p-interacting proteins identified come from a range of different processes, including cellular organization and protein synthesis.

Although the genetic components of the bacterial DDR have been studied extensively in isolation, how the underlying biological pathways interact functionally remains unclear. Here, we address this by performing systematic, unbiased, quantitative synthetic genetic interaction (GI) screens and uncover widespread changes in the GI network of the entire genomic integrity apparatus of Escherichia coli under standard and DNA-damaging growth conditions. The GI patterns of untreated cultures implicated two previously uncharacterized proteins (YhbQ and YqgF) as nucleases, whereas reorganization of the GI network after DNA damage revealed DDR roles for both annotated and uncharacterized genes. Analyses of pan-bacterial conservation patterns suggest that DDR mechanisms and functional relationships are near universal, highlighting a modular and highly adaptive genomic stress response.

Proteome-wide screens for the co-complexed subunits with HDAC1 and six other key ASD proteins in neuronal cells revealed a protein interaction network, which displayed preferential expression in fetal brain development, exhibited increased deleterious mutations in ASD cases, and were strongly regulated by FMRP and MECP2 causal for Fragile X and Rett syndromes, respectively.

To address this, we employed a plasmid-based NHEJ DNA repair screen in budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) using 369 putative nonessential DNA repair-related components as queries. Among the newly identified genes associated with NHEJ deficiency upon disruption are two spindle assembly checkpoint kinases, Bub1 and Bub2. Both observation of resulting phenotypes and chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated that Bub1 and -2, either alone or in combination with cell cycle regulators, are recruited near the DSB, where phosphorylated Rad53 or H2A accumulates. Large-scale proteomic analysis of Bub kinases phosphorylated in response to DNA damage identified previously unknown kinase substrates on Tel1 S/T-Q sites. Moreover, Bub1 NHEJ function appears to be conserved in mammalian cells. 53BP1, which influences DSB repair by NHEJ, colocalizes with human BUB1 and is recruited to the break sites.

Activated under conditions of high osmotic stress, it interacts with other HOG pathway proteins to mediate cell signaling events, ensuring that yeast cells can adapt and remain viable. In an attempt to further understand how the function of Sho1p is regulated through its protein-protein interactions (PPIs), we identified 49 unique Sho1p PPIs through the use of membrane yeast two-hybrid (MYTH), an assay specifically suited to identify PPIs of full-length integral membrane proteins in their native membrane environment. Secondary validation by literature search, or two complementary PPI assays, confirmed 80% of these interactions, resulting in a high-quality Sho1p interactome. This set of putative PPIs included both previously characterized interactors, along with a large subset of interactors that have not been previously identified as binding to Sho1p. The SH3 domain of Sho1p was found to be important for binding to many of these interactors. One particular novel interactor of interest is the glycerol transporter Fps1p, which was shown to require the SH3 domain of Sho1p for binding via its N-terminal soluble regulatory domain. Furthermore, we found that Fps1p is involved in the positive regulation of Sho1p function and plays a role in the phosphorylation of the downstream kinase Hog1p. This study represents the largest membrane interactome analysis of Sho1p to date and complements past studies on the HOG pathway by increasing our understanding of Sho1p regulation.

In mammalian cells, the efficient recruitment of retromer to endosomes requires the lipid phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) as well as Rab5 and Rab7 GTPases. However, in yeast, the role of Rabs in recruiting retromer to endosomes is less clear. We identified novel physical interactions between retromer and the Saccharomyces cerevisiae VPS9-domain Rab5-family guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) Muk1 and Vps9. Furthermore, we identified a new yeast VPS9 domain-containing protein, VARP-like 1 (Vrl1), which is related to the human VARP protein. All three VPS9 domain-containing proteins show localization to endosomes, and the presence of any one of them is necessary for the endosomal recruitment of retromer. We find that expression of an active VPS9-domain protein is required for correct localization of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase Vps34 and the production of endosomal PI3P. These results suggest that VPS9 GEFs promote retromer recruitment by establishing PI3P-enriched domains at the endosomal membrane. The interaction of retromer with distinct VPS9 GEFs could thus link GEF-dependent regulatory inputs to the temporal or spatial coordination of retromer assembly or function.

Consequently, many questions regarding the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in the development of human disease remain unanswered. To address this, we compiled all existing mitochondrial physical interaction data for over 1200 experimentally defined yeast MPs and, through bioinformatic analysis, identified hundreds of heteromeric MP complexes having extensive associations both within and outside the mitochondria. We provide support for these complexes through structure prediction analysis, morphological comparisons of deletion strains, and protein co-immunoprecipitation. The integration of these MP complexes with reported genetic interaction data reveals substantial crosstalk between MPs and non-MPs and identifies novel factors in endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondrial organization, membrane structure, and mitochondrial lipid homeostasis. More than one-third of these MP complexes are conserved in humans, with many containing members linked to clinical pathologies, enabling us to identify genes with putative disease function through guilt-by-association.

Also, we examine current strategies for mitochondrial drug discovery, focusing on genetic, proteomic, and chemogenomic assays, and relevant model systems.

Intrinsically kinase-deficient RTKs control a variety of biological responses, however, the mechanism of their downregulation is not well understood and its analysis is focused exclusively on the ErbB3 receptor. The Eph group of RTKs is represented by the EphA and EphB subclasses. Each bears one kinase-inactive member, EphA10 and EphB6, respectively, suggesting an important role for these molecules in the Eph signalling network. While EphB6 effects on cell behaviour have been assessed, the mechanism of its downregulation remains elusive. Our work reveals that EphB6 and its kinase-active relative, and signalling partner, EphB4, are downregulated in a similar manner in response to their common ligand, ephrin-B2. Following stimulation, both receptors are internalised through clathrin-coated pits and are degraded in lysosomes. Their targeting for lysosomal degradation relies on the activity of an early endosome regulator, the Rab5 GTPase, as this process is inhibited in the presence of a Rab5 dominant-negative mutant. EphB6 also interacts with the Hsp90 chaperone and EphB6 downregulation is preceded by their rapid dissociation. Moreover, the inhibition of Hsp90 results in EphB6 degradation, mimicking its ligand-induced downregulation. These processes appear to rely on overlapping mechanisms, since Hsp90 inhibition does not significantly enhance ligand-induced EphB6 elimination. Taken together, our observations define a novel mechanism for intrinsically kinase-deficient RTK downregulation and support an intriguing model, where Hsp90 dissociation acts as a trigger for ligand-induced receptor removal.

Physical interactions can be mapped with high confidence vialarge-scale isolation and characterization of endogenous protein complexes under near-physiological conditions based on affinity purification of chromosomally-tagged proteins in combination with mass spectrometry (APMS). This approach has been successfully applied in evolutionarily diverse organisms, including yeast, flies, worms, mammalian cells, and bacteria(1-6). In particular, we have generated a carboxy-terminal Sequential Peptide Affinity (SPA) dual tagging system for affinity-purifying native protein complexes from cultured gram-negative Escherichia coli, using genetically-tractable host laboratory strains that are well-suited for genome-wide investigations of the fundamental biology and conserved processes of prokaryotes(1, 2, 7). Our SPA-tagging system is analogous to the tandem affinity purification method developed originally for yeast(8, 9), and consists of a calmodulin binding peptide (CBP) followed by the cleavage site for the highly specific tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease and three copies of the FLAG epitope (3X FLAG), allowing for two consecutive rounds of affinity enrichment. After cassette amplification, sequence-specific linear PCR products encoding the SPA-tag and a selectable marker are integrated and expressed in frame as carboxy-terminal fusions in a DY330 background that is induced to transiently express a highly efficient heterologous bacteriophage lambda recombination system(10). Subsequent dual-step purification using calmodulin and anti-FLAG affinity beads enables the highly selective and efficient recovery of even low abundance protein complexes from large-scale cultures. Tandem mass spectrometry is then used to identify the stably co-purifying proteins with high sensitivity (low nanogram detection limits). Here, we describe detailed step-by-step procedures we commonly use for systematic protein tagging, purification and mass spectrometry-based analysis of soluble protein complexes from E. coli, which can be scaled up and potentially tailored to other bacterial species, including certain opportunistic pathogens that are amenable to recombineering. The resulting physical interactions can often reveal interesting unexpected components and connections suggesting novel mechanistic links. Integration of the PPI data with alternate molecular association data such as genetic (gene-gene) interactions and genomic-context (GC) predictions can facilitate elucidation of the global molecular organization of multi-protein complexes within biological pathways. The networks generated for E. coli can be used to gain insight into the functional architecture of orthologous gene products in other microbes for which functional annotations are currently lacking.","tags":null,"title":"Identification of protein complexes in Escherichia coli using sequential peptide affinity purification in combination with tandem mass spectrometry.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alla Gagarinova","Mohan Babu","Jack Greenblatt","Andrew Emili"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1351728000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1351728000,"objectID":"e36df4fd17e97ef1920a6303f3ca9420","permalink":"http://192.157.236.170/BabuLab/publication/pmid-23168417/","publishdate":"2020-07-10T06:21:58.925049Z","relpermalink":"/BabuLab/publication/pmid-23168417/","section":"publication","summary":"Phenotypes are determined by a complex series of physical (e.g. protein-protein) and functional (e.g. gene-gene or genetic) interactions (GI)(1). While physical interactions can indicate which bacterial proteins are associated as complexes, they do not necessarily reveal pathway-level functional relationships1. GI screens, in which the growth of double mutants bearing two deleted or inactivated genes is measured and compared to the corresponding single mutants, can illuminate epistatic dependencies between loci and hence provide a means to query and discover novel functional relationships(2). Large-scale GI maps have been reported for eukaryotic organisms like yeast(3-7), but GI information remains sparse for prokaryotes(8), which hinders the functional annotation of bacterial genomes. To this end, we and others have developed high-throughput quantitative bacterial GI screening methods(9, 10). Here, we present the key steps required to perform quantitative E. coli Synthetic Genetic Array (eSGA) screening procedure on a genome-scale(9), using natural bacterial conjugation and homologous recombination to systemically generate and measure the fitness of large numbers of double mutants in a colony array format. Briefly, a robot is used to transfer, through conjugation, chloramphenicol (Cm) - marked mutant alleles from engineered Hfr (High frequency of recombination) 'donor strains' into an ordered array of kanamycin (Kan) - marked F- recipient strains. Typically, we use loss-of-function single mutants bearing non-essential gene deletions (e.g. the 'Keio' collection(11)) and essential gene hypomorphic mutations (i.e. alleles conferring reduced protein expression, stability, or activity(9, 12, 13)) to query the functional associations of non-essential and essential genes, respectively. After conjugation and ensuing genetic exchange mediated by homologous recombination, the resulting double mutants are selected on solid medium containing both antibiotics. After outgrowth, the plates are digitally imaged and colony sizes are quantitatively scored using an in-house automated image processing system(14). GIs are revealed when the growth rate of a double mutant is either significantly better or worse than expected(9). Aggravating (or negative) GIs often result between loss-of-function mutations in pairs of genes from compensatory pathways that impinge on the same essential process(2). Here, the loss of a single gene is buffered, such that either single mutant is viable. However, the loss of both pathways is deleterious and results in synthetic lethality or sickness (i.e. slow growth). Conversely, alleviating (or positive) interactions can occur between genes in the same pathway or protein complex(2) as the deletion of either gene alone is often sufficient to perturb the normal function of the pathway or complex such that additional perturbations do not reduce activity, and hence growth, further. Overall, systematically identifying and analyzing GI networks can provide unbiased, global maps of the functional relationships between large numbers of genes, from which pathway-level information missed by other approaches can be inferred(9).","tags":null,"title":"Mapping bacterial functional networks and pathways in Escherichia Coli using synthetic genetic arrays.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mohan Babu","James Vlasblom","Shuye Pu","Xinghua Guo","Chris Graham","Björn D M Bean","Helen E Burston","Franco J Vizeacoumar","Jamie Snider","Sadhna Phanse","Vincent Fong","Yuen Yi C Tam","Michael Davey","Olha Hnatshak","Navgeet Bajaj","Shamanta Chandran","Thanuja Punna","Constantine Christopolous","Victoria Wong","Analyn Yu","Gouqing Zhong","Joyce Li","Igor Stagljar","Elizabeth Conibear","Shoshana J Wodak","Andrew Emili","Jack F Greenblatt"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1346457600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1346457600,"objectID":"b086b41f6f194ab9faf268b45909212a","permalink":"http://192.157.236.170/BabuLab/publication/pmid-22940862/","publishdate":"2020-07-10T06:21:58.926083Z","relpermalink":"/BabuLab/publication/pmid-22940862/","section":"publication","summary":"Macromolecular assemblies involving membrane proteins (MPs) serve vital biological roles and are prime drug targets in a variety of diseases.

Accurate and sensitive identification of both the specific and shared polypeptide components of distinct complexes requires purification to near homogeneity. To this end, a sequential peptide affinity (SPA) purification system was developed to enable the rapid and efficient isolation of native Escherichia coli protein complexes (J Proteome Res 3:463-468, 2004). SPA purification makes use of a dual-affinity tag, consisting of three modified FLAG sequences (3X FLAG) and a calmodulin binding peptide (CBP), spaced by a cleavage site for tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease (J Proteome Res 3:463-468, 2004). Using the lambda-phage Red homologous recombination system (PNAS 97:5978-5983, 2000), a DNA cassette, encoding the SPA-tag and a selectable marker flanked by gene-specific targeting sequences, is introduced into a selected locus in the E. coli chromosome so as to create a C-terminal fusion with the protein of interest. This procedure aims for near-endogenous levels of tagged protein production in the recombinant bacteria to avoid spurious, non-specific protein associations (J Proteome Res 3:463-468, 2004).

Arabidopsis protoplasts were transfected with a PPV infectious clone and global gene expression changes in the transfected protoplasts were profiled.","tags":null,"title":"Altered gene expression changes in Arabidopsis leaf tissues and protoplasts in response to Plum pox virus infection.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xurong Tang","Anfu Hou","Mohan Babu","Vi Nguyen","Lidia Hurtado","Qing Lu","Jose C Reyes","Aiming Wang","Wilfred A Keller","John J Harada","Edward W T Tsang","Yuhai Cui"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1214870400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1214870400,"objectID":"fef29f40431ca18cfc7f1393756dec7d","permalink":"http://192.157.236.170/BabuLab/publication/pmid-18508955/","publishdate":"2020-07-10T06:21:58.997682Z","relpermalink":"/BabuLab/publication/pmid-18508955/","section":"publication","summary":"Synthesis and accumulation of seed storage proteins (SSPs) is an important aspect of the seed maturation program. Genes encoding SSPs are specifically and highly expressed in the seed during maturation. However, the mechanisms that repress the expression of these genes in leaf tissue are not well understood. To gain insight into the repression mechanisms, we performed a genetic screen for mutants that express SSPs in leaves. Here, we show that mutations affecting BRAHMA (BRM), a SNF2 chromatin-remodeling ATPase, cause ectopic expression of a subset of SSPs and other embryogenesis-related genes in leaf tissue. Consistent with the notion that such SNF2-like ATPases form protein complexes in vivo, we observed similar phenotypes for mutations of AtSWI3C, a BRM-interacting partner, and BSH, a SNF5 homolog and essential SWI/SNF subunit. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments show that BRM is recruited to the promoters of a number of embryogenesis genes in wild-type leaves, including the 2S genes, expressed in brm leaves. Consistent with its role in nucleosome remodeling, BRM appears to affect the chromatin structure of the At2S2 promoter. Thus, the BRM-containing chromatin-remodeling ATPase complex involved in many aspects of plant development mediates the repression of SSPs in leaf tissue.","tags":null,"title":"The Arabidopsis BRAHMA chromatin-remodeling ATPase is involved in repression of seed maturation genes in leaves.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mohan Babu","Alla G Gagarinova","James E Brandle","Aiming Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1207008000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1207008000,"objectID":"6f90483b76f6819282c97a1452cd282b","permalink":"http://192.157.236.170/BabuLab/publication/pmid-18343851/","publishdate":"2020-07-10T06:21:58.999733Z","relpermalink":"/BabuLab/publication/pmid-18343851/","section":"publication","summary":"Compatible virus infection induces and suppresses host gene expression at the global level.

The tumor provides an environment for hyphal differentiation, leading to the formation of thick-walled, diploid teliospores. Such spores serve as a dispersal agent for smut and rust fungi, and their germination leads to new rounds of infection. The morphological changes that occur during teliospore germination in U. maydis have been described in detail. However, the specific molecular events that facilitate this process have not been identified. Through the construction and hybridization of microarrays containing a set of 3918 non-redundant cDNAs, we have identified genes that are differentially regulated during teliospore germination. Teliospores induced to germinate for 4 and 11 h were selected for comparison with dormant teliospores. Genes identified as differentially expressed included many that are presumably involved in as yet undescribed molecular events during teliospore germination, as well as characterized genes previously shown to be required for the process. This study represents the first large-scale investigation of changes in gene expression during teliospore germination.","tags":null,"title":"Differential gene expression during teliospore germination in Ustilago maydis.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mohan R Babu","Kristen Choffe","Barry J Saville"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1114905600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1114905600,"objectID":"1e0e373dc37f1283c97f9111c1fadb65","permalink":"http://192.157.236.170/BabuLab/publication/pmid-15809875/","publishdate":"2020-07-10T06:21:59.00074Z","relpermalink":"/BabuLab/publication/pmid-15809875/","section":"publication","summary":"When fungi interact with plants as pathogens or as symbionts, there are often changes in fungal cell morphology and nuclear state. This study establishes the use of cDNA microarrays to detect gene expression changes in Ustilago maydis cells that differ in structure and nuclear content. Categorizing differentially expressed genes on the basis of function indicated that U. maydis cell types vary most in the expression of genes related to metabolism. We also observed that more genes are up-regulated in the filamentous dikaryon than in the filamentous diploid, relative to non-pathogenic budding cells. Our comparison of pathogenic development indicated that the dikaryon is more virulent than the diploid. Other identified expression patterns suggest a cell-specific difference in nutrient acquisition, cell metabolism and signal transduction.
