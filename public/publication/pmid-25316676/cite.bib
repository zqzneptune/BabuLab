 abstract = {The model bacterium Escherichia coli is among the best studied prokaryotes, yet nearly half of its proteins are still of unknown biological function. This is despite a wealth of available large-scale physical and genetic interaction data. To address this, we extended the GeneMANIA function prediction web application developed for model eukaryotes to support E.coli.},
